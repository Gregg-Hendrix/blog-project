      <p> Awakening is the state of expanded awareness within the conciousness. This state of mind is not just for those that have meditated for years or months. Dear reader, you also can expand your awareness!
    </p>

    <p> The expansion of awareness comes from a continual curiosity of the mind. By asking oneself "Is this so", begins the journey into awakening.This journey never ends, so there is no rush to progress through it. The beauty of this journey is that you get to walk down this path for the rest of your life! You conciousness will develop into a compassionate friend, rather than a judgemental presence.</p>

    <p> As you read this blog, please ask yourself "Is this so?". An open mind is a handy tool to navigate the conciousness. What you will find within this blog are meditations, techniques, practices, and embodiments that all aid in the awakening of the psyche.</p>
