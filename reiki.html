                <p>Reiki is an energy healing modality. Reiki is the process of flowing Rei (Universal) and Ki (Life Energy) to any areas where the physical/mental/emotional/spiritual body needs care. Whoa there, hold up, I’m already lost. I don’t believe in energy healing, I believe in science, this sounds like some *woo woo* nonsense. Dear reader, I felt the exact same way. I was drawn to Reiki to aid in credits to become a massage therapist (a practice that has proven medical benefits!). I begrudgingly took the course and figured that it would be some easy credits to get out of the way, My training in Reiki, fundamentally changed the way I view energy. Here we go again with that energy talk! Alright, let’s define some terms to make this more digestible.<em>So what’s energy?</em> According to the dictionary <em>Energy is the capacity to do work</em>, when we distill that down, energy is *potential*</p>

                <p><em>Can this *Energy* be scientifically measured?</em> – Yes. In hospitals they frequently use MRI’s (magnetic resonance imaging). This tool uses magnets to bounce radio waves off the protons within the water molecules inhabiting our body. What? We’re largely made up of water (hydrogen + oxygen) at the center of those atoms is the home of the proton (which operates like a magnet)In summary, the MRI is NOT measuring the physical body. It is sending a wave (energy) through the body to interact with our own electromagnetic field. This *field* shows the potential (energy) of distortions within our body. f you believe in science, then your subscribing to the belief that we do carry an *invisible field of information within the body*. <em>Ok, so machines can affect this field, but what about humans?</em></p>
                
                <p>This field can be explained by Mirror Neurons. Science has proven that when we observe someone doing an act, there is a neuron (the mirror neuron) within our own brain that *learns* and responds to that action. Monkey see, monkey do! Just for some background, a neuron is responsible for receiving sensory input from the EXTERNAL world. It then transmits this electrical signal/ information (energy) to the physical body to transform it in a multitude of ways.</p>
                
                <span><em>I think I’m more confused than I was at the beginning of this blog post. Never fear dear reader, here’s where it all comes together!</em></span>
                
                <p>How is Reiki done? – The practitioner of Reiki is connecting themselves to universal life energy (if you still like science lingo, we can call this ATP).  The channel then sends this information (energy) into the field of the recipient. The receiver of Reiki observes this information which causes the mirror neurons to produce the same information intrinsically. It us up to the recipient to (or not to) incorporate the information (energy) into their own electromagnetic field.</p>
                
                <p>Where does this energy flow? To wherever the participant is focused on, as your attention uses the most energy (ATP). The Reiki master is just a catalyst to active your natural healing abilities (remember the scabs that form on your skin after a cut, that’s you healing yourself!). This modality is powerful because it is non-invasive and has no harmful side-effects!</p>
