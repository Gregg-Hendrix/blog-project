            <p>We are all familiar with conditioned responses (if not, think of Pavlov’s dogs). Now think of your workplace, you’ve entered into the office so many times that your body has been conditioned to behave in a certain way. Maybe you grab a cup of coffee, check your email, and then check your workplace *to do list*. You’ve done this so many times that you may be running on autopilot. Then your boss wants to improve productivity. So now there’s a barista at your workplace (rather than you making a cup), there’s a mobile app for your email (rather than a desktop site), and now your *to do list* is emailed to you rather than you finding it on the office wall. Great, we’re more productive! Upon further digging, what’s changed about you? Nothing really, the environment has changed but your internal traits are the same.</p>
            
            <p>Mindfulness Meditation has shown that it changes the operational architecture of the brain (especially in the hippocampus- a major location of memory and learning). That change in the brain is like switching from a pedal bicycle to a motorcycle. It’s been medically proven that myelination of your neuronal sheath occurs with meditation (which helps the neurons fire up to 100 times faster!). So it’s incredibly valid to claim that you’ll think faster and more efficiently. So what’s this all have to do with meditating at work?</p>
            
            <p>Imagine if your auto-pilot was to be incredible, not average, but truly incredible. The workplace gives us a wonderful opportunity to test this theory, since most of us spend about 8 hours a day at work it’s one of the birthplaces of conditioning (repetition, repetition, and repetition). Now imagine if you meditated for 5 minutes every day at your desk. This simple task would condition your mind to focus. This has the aforementioned consequence of myelination of your neurons (making your brain work more quickly), growth of new neurons (new ideas), and synaptic growth (linking new ideas).</p>
            
            <p>Over time, thanks to conditioning, it wouldn’t even feel like a task. You would just automatically be better equipped to handle the unpredictability of work life. Where others will try to adapt to the ever changing landscape of work, you will have made a much more efficient adaptation, as you will have changed the very structure of your brain. When the boss wants nuanced ideas that still connect to the brands philosophy, and needs those ideas quickly, who is going to have the brainpower to crank out proposal after proposal? You are, because the others will still be sipping their coffee.</p>
            
            <p>Ok so now I’m interested, but I don’t want the hippie stigma at my corporate job. How can I meditate at work without bringing attention to my practice?</p>
            
            <p>If your interested in trying the practice of meditation with stealth, you’ll need some tools (a wrist/pocket watch or a phone with a timer function). Plan how long you want to meditate, I suggest 5 minutes, and set your timer to accommodate that time. Find the most talkative person in the workplace, then start your timer as you approach them and ask them about their day. Here’s the catch, actively listen to every word that comes out of their mouth. Research shows that active listening actually improves work performance, so that small talk that we often observe actually isn’t a waste of time. This is also a meditation because it requires you to focus your attention and hold that attention for a prolonged period of time.</p>
            
            <p>If this doesn’t strike your fancy, you can always take 5 minutes out of your lunch break and count from 1-10, then back down from 10-1 which is zazen meditation (or simply observe your breath for 5 minutes).</p>
            
            <p>Don’t take my word for it, try it out and see if it works for you!</p>
